Challenge:  the Pythonic card deck class

The class CardDeck below represents a pack
of cards.

Find out how to use magic methods so that the
following three standard functions work:

    >>> import random
    >>> deck = CardDeck()
    >>> len(deck)
    52
    >>> print(deck[0])
    2♠
    >>> print(deck[-1])
    A♣
    >>> random.choice(deck) in list(deck)
    True
    >>> random.shuffle(deck)

Tip:
If you have lines in the docstring (this string) that look like interactive
Python sessions, you can use the doctest module to run and test this code.

Try: python3 -m doctest -v magic_methods.py

See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html

I stole this example.

Bonus exercise: Polynomial class

Create a class that represents polynomials.  You may need to stretch your memory back to high school maths!

A polynomial loks like

    2(xx) - x + 7

And its essential features are the coefficients of each power of x

in this example, power-2=2, power-1=-1, power-0=7
